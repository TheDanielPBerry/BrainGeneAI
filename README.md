# BrainGeneAI
This uses the SharpNeat library to generate a neural network using genetic algorithms. 
This neural network is capable of beating the BrainGene game available at https://github.com/TheDanielPBerry/BrainGene.
The game will be played hundreds of times until a satisfactory neural network is built that is capable of beating the game.
